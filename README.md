Dirlisting
==========

Simple and easy directory file listing and browsing PHP script. It's
like a better looking and more advanced replacement for the autoindex
feature found in Apache/Nginx.

Just put this single PHP file in the directory you want to list, and all
underlying files and folders will be browsable in a nice UI.
